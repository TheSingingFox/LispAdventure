# LispAdventure
A text adventure, written in Lisp, for the purpose of learning the language.

## Story
There is no story yet. I'm just trying to get everything to work.

## What works?
As of yet, you can move around the rooms, look in your inventory, look at what's in the room (at least in the kitchen).
