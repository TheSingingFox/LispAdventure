# LispAdventure
A text adventure, written in Common Lisp, for the purpose of me learning the language.

## Story
There is no story yet. I'm just trying to get everything to work.

## What works?
As of yet, you can move around the rooms, look in your inventory, look at what's in the room and put it in your inventory.
It stays in the room as well, though, so you could say you're cloning it into your inventory.
